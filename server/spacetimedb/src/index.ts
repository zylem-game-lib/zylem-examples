/**
 * SpacetimeDB module entry. The CLI bundles this file and the schema's
 * `[moduleHooks](exports)` registers every named export below as a reducer
 * (or lifecycle hook). All reducers are defined in the `./reducers/`
 * subfolder against the single shared `spacetime` instance from `./schema`.
 *
 * NOTE: `[moduleHooks]` rejects any named export that is not a SpacetimeDB
 * `ModuleExport`, so this file MUST re-export reducers/lifecycle hooks
 * only — never helper constants or functions. Helpers stay scoped to
 * their reducer files (and are imported directly between reducer files
 * when needed).
