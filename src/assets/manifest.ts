/**
 * Unified CDN asset manifest for every demo pack.
 *
 * Single source of truth for every binary asset (models, animations,
 * textures, UI images) the demos load at runtime. Per-pack hashed
 * relative paths live in sibling `*.manifest.ts` files and are merged
 * here; the {@link demoAsset} helper composes them with a
 * configurable base URL.
 *
 * Why split base + path:
 *   - **Dev**: a Vite proxy at `/cdn` forwards to `assets.zylem.cloud`
 *     so the browser sees same-origin requests and CORS errors don't
 *     block local development.
 *   - **Prod**: the base resolves to the real CDN origin so deployed
 *     builds load assets directly from `assets.zylem.cloud`. The CDN
 *     bucket must be configured with CORS rules permitting the deploy
 *     origin (see `scripts/cdn/r2-cors.json`).
 *   - **CI / overrides**: set `VITE_DEMOS_ASSET_BASE_URL` to point at
 *     a staging CDN, a local mirror, or any other host without
 *     touching this file.
 *
 * Adding a new pack:
 *   1. Create `<pack>.manifest.ts` next to this file, exporting
 *      `<PACK>_ASSET_PATHS` with `<pack>/...`-prefixed keys.
 *   2. Import it below and spread into {@link ASSET_PATHS}.
 *   3. The {@link DemoAssetKey} union and every `demoAsset(...)` call
 *      site is re-checked by `tsc`.
